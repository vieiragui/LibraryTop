# LibraryTop
Library with several generics methods and function

If you don't want to download the solution, just go to the LibraryTop/bin/Debug/ folder and download the two files LibraryTop.dll and LibraryTop.xml. 
Then import LibraryTop.dll into the project. The two files must be in the same folder, so the messages describing the methods and functions will appear.
